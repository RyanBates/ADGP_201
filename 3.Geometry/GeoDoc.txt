Rendering Geometry:
Purpose:
Render Plane(Static)
Render Cube(Static)
Render Sphere(Procedural)&&(Method described in class)
Shadders separate file

Learning outcome: 
	Learned the rendering pipeline to display to the screen.

Lighting:
Purpose:
Diffuse implementation with pictures/documentation.
Ambient implementation with pictures/documentation.
Specular implementation with  pictures/documentation.
Understand difference between blinn-phong and phong.


Learning outcome:
	Learned the equations for the three listed lighting effects above. As well as why blinn-phong is dimmer than the phong shader.


Ambient:

Diffuse:

All Three:
