# ADGP_201


specifications for assessment:

Intro to OpenGL:
Purpose: 
 setup of GLFW library 
Setup of OpenGL library
Must use environment variables ie:$(SolutionDir)
Must use inheritance. OOP in design involving a base class and classes that will inherit from this base class.


Learning outcome:
Learned how to use the environment variables to set up the libraries then use those libraries to do what was needed to meet the requirements of drawing with gizmos. 


// lot of compiler errors
Camera:
Purpose:
Camera Class
Must use inheritance.

Learning outcome: 
 	learned how to use maxtries and showed have an understanding on how to use inheritance.
 

Rendering Geometry:
Purpose:
Render Plane(Static)
Render Cube(Static)
Render Sphere(Procedural)&&(Method described in class)
Shadders separate file

Learning outcome: 
	Learned the rendering pipeline to display to the screen.

Lighting:
Purpose:
Diffuse implementation with pictures/documentation.
Ambient implementation with pictures/documentation.
Specular implementation with  pictures/documentation.
Understand difference between blinn-phong and phong.


Learning outcome:
	Learned the equations for the three listed lighting effects above. As well as why blinn-phong is dimmer than the phong shader.

//didnt get here
Textures:
Purpose:
UV mapping.
Texture applied to plane.

Learning outcome:
	Used more libraries to put a texture on a plane and model.


//didnt get here
Procedural Generation:
Purpose:
Generate perlin noise map.
Vertex shader sampling perlin noise map.

Learning outcome:
	

Overall Problems:
Had problems with the projects breaking with the first item in startup no matter the order of them
When the projects did not break they would not draw.
 When opened projects that worked from school computer and opened them at home did not work and checked to make sure libraries were there.
